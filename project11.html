                    <p> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.</p>
                    <p> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                        language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
                    <P> JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                        on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</P>
                    <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                        a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                        manipulations on a server.</p>

                        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                    code:
                    <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert("Hello " + yourName);
              }
              greetMe("World");
              </code>
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

                    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                        identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                        characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                        characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        
                        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as 책 and 체 in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                        escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99,
                        and _name. </p>

                    <header><b>Declaring variables</b></header>
                    <id class="Declaring_variables"></id>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
        
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                    <code>
                var x = 42.
               </code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>
                x = 42.
                </code>
                    This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.
        
                    With the keyword let. For example,
                    <code>
                let y = 13.
                </code>
                    This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

                <section class="main-section">
                    <header><b>Variable scope</b></header>
                    <id class="Variable_scope"></id>
                    <code>
                if (true) {
                  var x = 5;
                }
                console.log(x);  // 5
                </code>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                    <code>
                if (true) {
                  let y = 5;
                }
                console.log(y);  
                // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                </code>
